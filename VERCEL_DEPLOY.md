# 🚀 Deploy to Vercel - Quick Start

## Step 1: Install Vercel CLI
```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

## Step 2: Deploy Your App
```bash
# Login to Vercel (opens browser)
vercel login

# Deploy the application
vercel

# Follow these prompts:
# ? Set up and deploy? [Y/n] Y
# ? Which scope? [Select your account]
# ? Link to existing project? [y/N] N  
# ? Project name? invoice-validation
# ? Directory? [./] (press enter)
# ? Want to modify settings? [y/N] N
```

## Step 3: Set Environment Variables (Optional)
If you want to connect to the real Python validation later:
```bash
vercel env add AMPLIFY_API_KEY
vercel env add AMPLIFY_API_URL
```

## Step 4: Access Your Live App! 🎉
Vercel will provide you with a URL like:
```
https://invoice-validation-abc123.vercel.app
```

## What Works Immediately:
✅ Beautiful React frontend
✅ File upload functionality  
✅ Mock validation responses
✅ Complete UI/UX experience
✅ Mobile responsive design

## What You'll Need Later:
⚠️ Deploy Python validation service separately (Railway/Render)
⚠️ Update API endpoints to use real validation

## Alternative: Deploy via GitHub
1. Push to GitHub repository
2. Connect GitHub to Vercel
3. Auto-deploy on every push
