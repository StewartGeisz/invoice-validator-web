(node:38280) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///C:/Users/stewa/OneDrive/Desktop/VERCEL/pdf-vendor-matcher.js is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to C:\Users\stewa\OneDrive\Desktop\VERCEL\package.json.
